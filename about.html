        <title>About</title>

        <p>Devoid GNU/Linux is a GNU/Linux distribution that is running on Void GNU/Linux (yes, running, not based off of.)</p>

        <p>It is not like Manjaro or Ubuntu, whereas those are <b>BASED</b> off of their parent distros. But, Devoid is Void, just with some modifications. That's all</p>
        <p>Absolutely no credit goes to me, all goes to the Void Creators for making their beautiful distro.</p>
        <p>You can find them at <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">https://voidlinux.org</a></p>
